      <description>11 days into the challenge and first results are here. Another Qwiklab quest about Kubernetes is done and a fantastic course about Networking from Pluralsight by Ross Bagurdes is completed. Besides that, I finished 2 books and articles about building reliable systems which I‚Äôll cover later in separate posts.
üè´Qwiklabs quests about Kubernetes (K8S). Qwiklabs offers a variety of quests and labs about K8S. But after completing 2 quests devoted to Kubernetes and Kubernetes in GCP I found myself in a situation where I would type some commands into the Cloud shell inside GCP without really understanding what‚Äôs going on.</description>

      <description>DevOps and Cloud continue to be one of the most demanded skills in the IT market. I can see a lot of trending DevOps learning topics in Google Trends/YouTube and other platforms. At the same time amount of available educational resources is a bit overwhelming: online courses, books and special e-learning platforms.
As I decided to renew and deepen my knowledge in DevOps and surrounding topics I started a #100DaysOfDevOps challenge where I will learn, read and pass courses about the required technologies every day.</description>
